## Blackjack

#### Skill Distillery Week 3 Homework
This app simulates a simple Blackjack game.

#### How to play
When the game first runs, the user will be asked if they want to play.  The game
begins when the player types "Y".  From there, the player is prompted throughout
to stay or hit depending on the value of the hand.

#### Lessons Learned
Logic flow was the hardest part because the game can go down various paths
depending on both player and dealer's hand values.  Debugging wasn't hard, but
rather time-consuming because I tried to keep from repeating code while still trying
to meeting the requirements of the game.
